\begin{problem}
  Two aliens have arrived on Earth, each claiming to possess a machine that can
  solve the $\SAT$ problem in polynomial time.
  However, only one of these machines is genuine, while the other is a
  counterfeit.
  Your task is to design a protocol for solving the $\SAT$ problem in polynomial
  time by asking questions to their machines.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  
  Let the two aliens be $A$ and $B$,
  and their machines be $M_{A}$ and $M_{B}$ respectively.
  Given a formula $\varphi$ as input,
  we ask $M_{A}$ and $M_{B}$ whether $\varphi$ is satisfiable or not.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If both machines output ``yes'', then the answer is ``yes''.
    \item If both machines output ``no'', then the answer is ``no''.
    \item If one machine outputs ``yes'' and the other outputs ``no'',
      then we proceed to the next step. Without loss of generality,
      assume that $M_{A}$ outputs ``yes'' and $M_{B}$ outputs ``no''.
      Consider algorithm $S$ as follows:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item For $i = 1, 2, \cdots, n$ do:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Use $M_{A}$ to check whether
            $\varphi(a_1, \cdots, a_{i-1}, 0, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_n)$
            is satisfiable or not.
          \item If so, set $a_i = 0$. Otherwise, set $a_i = 1$.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Check if $a = (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n)$ is a satisfying assignment for $\varphi$.
          If so, then the answer is ``yes''. Otherwise, the answer is ``no''.
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  
  Therefore, the protocol above can solve the $\SAT$ problem in polynomial time.

%     A DNF formula is the logical OR of terms where each term is the logical AND
%     of literals.
%     The width of a DNF formula is the maximum number of literals in a term and
%     the size of of it is the number of terms.
%     Prove that $x_{1} \land x_{2} \land \cdots \land x_{N}$ cannot be computed
%     by a DNF formula $\varphi(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{N})$ of width less then
%     $N$.
%     \part\label{c} Use \cref{b} to construct an oracle $C$ such that
%     $L(C) \not\in \NP^{C}$ thereby showing that $\NP^{C} \ne \coNP^{C}$.
